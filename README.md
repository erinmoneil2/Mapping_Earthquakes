# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

Tasks
Within this project, we use a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. We have already added this data to a map during the module. We are then tasked to add a layer to our map depicted where the tectonic plate is. Lastly, we add an addtional layer to depict all earthquakes with a magnitude of 4.5 or greater in a "Major Earthquakes" overlay.

## Deliverable 1
Below is the map showing the added tectonic plate.

## Deliverable 2 
Below depicts the overlay of Major Earthquakes with a magnitude of 4.5 of greater.

## Deliverable 3
In deliverable 3, we add an additional map style to have 3 different styles to see the map. In this case, I added a dark layer.
